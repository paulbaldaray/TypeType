# TypeType
Quickly Guess the Javascript Types!!

## Motivation
I have been playing around and practicing basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a while now and I wanted to see what I could build in a 2-hours (Additional edits probably bring it to over an hour though anyways). Goals are to have fun and practice basic web-dev skills.

## Gameplay
Javascript is an... interesting language with some questionable design choices. One of this is its weak type system which features type coercion that's often done implicitly and questionably. This game seeks to test your knowledge on what the actual type of a javascript expression is.

As soon as you press start, the timer will start and you will only have a few seconds to type the type of the Javascript expression displayed above. You don't have to press Enter you just have to make sure its correct inside the textbox.
